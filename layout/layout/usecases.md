# Usecases

So, what are the uses of the new menu item Product tag view?Here is all what you can achieve with the tag layout of J2Store:

* Assign a product to multiple categories
* Display brand-wise products.

## Assigning a product to multiple categories: <a id="assigning-a-product-to-multiple-categories"></a>

With the conventional list layout, it is possible to organize products based on their categories. However, there is one catch. It is not possible to assign a product to multiple categories.

Overcoming this, now we have the tag layout where it is possible for a product to be assigned to multiple categories.

**Steps to be followed:**

* Create tags that you wish to link with the product.
* Create a product and add the tags to the product.
* Create menus and link the tags with the respective menus.

### Scenario <a id="scenario"></a>

Products like Coffee mugs should be available under two categories- Kitchen appliances and Gifts.

**Steps to be done:**

* Create two tags: Gifts, Kitchen appliances.
* Create a product named coffee mugs.
* Assign both the tags to the product article.
* Create menu items of the type Product tag view: Kitchen appliances associating the tag kitchen appliancesGifts associating the tag Gifts.
* Now the product coffee mugs will be available in both Kitchen appliances and Gifts.

Likewise, we can assign products to as many categories as we wish.
