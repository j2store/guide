# Money Order

A money order is a payment order for a pre-specified amount of money. As it is required that the funds be prepaid for the amount shown on it, it is a more trusted method of payment than a cheque. The fields in this page are almost alike to bank transfer except the money order information. Instead of bank account details, here money order details are to be given. All other fields are same.
