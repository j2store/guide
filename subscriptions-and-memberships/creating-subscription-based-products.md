## Pricing <a id="pricing"></a>

**Subscription price :** Enter the membership price \(for example, $ 29\) based on either daily or weekly or monthly or yearly basis.For example, if you would like to give subscription price $ 29 for only 3 months, then enter $ $ 29 in the first text box and then choose every 3rd from the dropdown list and then choose month from third dropdown list.

**Subscription length :** The subscription length duration will be listed based on the recurring period you selected above. For example, if your subscription product’s duration period is only for 3 months, Choose 3 months. So the subscription will end at the end of 3rd month.If you would like to give a life time price for your subscription product \(i.e.\) wants to collect $29 at the end of every 3 months for lifetime, choose Never Expire to Subscription length. So $ 29 for every 3rd month for lifetime.

**Add / Remove user groups :** Users will be added and removed from the Joomla user groups when their subscription to the level is enabled or disabled.

**Sign-up fee :** This app allows you to collect one time set up fee or sign up fee from your customers. Enter your sign up fee here. For example, $5 or $10.

**Renewal discount :** If you wants to give the same discount to the customer during renewals. Checking this checkbox will override any renewal discount set globally in the app settings.
