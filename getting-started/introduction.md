J2Store is a native, flexible and modern ecommerce solution for Joomla Content Management System.

J2Store uses the default Joomla articles as its products. It can also be integrated with other content construction kits \(CCK\) like K2, Sebold, Zoo and SobiPro.

**NOTE:** Integration plugins are required to connect J2Store with CCK’s like K2.

You can sell anything with J2Store. Be it is a physical, downloadable or virtual product, J2Store can handle them.

It is light-weight and more importantly, it lets you use native content as product. This gives you a lot of benefits like flexibility.
