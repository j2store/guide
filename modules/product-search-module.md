# Product search module

Having hundreds of products?

Wishing that your users get what they want easily?

You could always help them with this search module.

This module facilitates the search of products in j2store. When the name of the product is typed in this search box, the products that have a part or whole of the keywords typed will get displayed.

**I already have the joomla search box. Why would I add this module?**

Is that your question? Then here is the answer:

This search box serves more or less like the joomla search box but with few differences. While the joomla search box is capable of searching j2store articles, there is one exception for its functionalities.

Joomla search box will not be able to search products if products list view is used to display the products but it is capable of finding those that are displayed using article or category blog layout.

Whereas,J2store search box is capable of picking products that are displayed using products list view as well, thus overcoming the default joomla search box’s limitation.

J2Store search box will search the product’s title, SKU, Description.

**Installation**

Product search module can be downloaded from our site and installed using the default joomla installer.

To configure the settings:

Go to Extensions-&gt;Modules-&gt;J2Store Products search module .

**Plugin settings**

* **Module class suffix** Enter the class suffix if you wish to style the module.

**Limitations**
