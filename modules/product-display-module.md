The module which helps you to display the products wherever you want in your site. Sometimes you would like to showcase best selling products or featured products in your site on some specific place. In this case, the product display module will do that.

**Basic settings**

**Sub-template**

The module comes with three following sub-templates:

* **Default**: Choose this as your sub-template if your site’s template has bootstrap 2 support.
* **Bootstrap 3**: If your site’s template has full bootstrap3 support, then choose Bootstrap 3 as your sub-template.
* **Carousel**: If you would like to showcase your products in a slider mode, then choose carousel as your sub-template. This will enable auto slide on the products.

**J2Store menu id**

If you have atleast one menu item with type as J2Store &gt; Product list view, the links on the product will take the id of that menu. If you don’t have any menu, then the link will use the non-sef url for the title and image on the product.

If you wants to use sef url, then create atleast one menu item with type J2Store &gt; Product list view and then choose this menu in this option.

**Display product based on following sort**

You can sort out the arrangement of product by using this option. For example, if you would like to display the products based on SKU, then you can choose either SKU \(A_Z\) or SKU \(Z_A\).
