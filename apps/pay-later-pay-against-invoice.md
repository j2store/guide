**Use cases**

This app can be possible at below two use cases.

**Use Case 1:** Invoice first, collect payment online

In the traditional methods, you would have to ask customers to manually transfer the money to your bank. You can now automate this process.

Just create an order in the backend, send the invoice to the customer and when he is ready, he can just view the order and make the payment online. No hassles in collecting payments.

For example, consider you are designing and selling gift cards. You can get quote and gift card details from customer. Once you finished designing gift card and it is ready to sell him, just create an unpaid order from store backend and send the invoice. So customer can view the order and make the payment online.

**Use Case 2 :** Allow customers to re-try payment for unpaid orders

Sometimes, customers abandon the order and leave your site without making payment. You can now easily close those abandoned orders by allowing customers to re-try the payment from their order history page.
