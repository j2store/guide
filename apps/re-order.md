# Re-Order

Allow your customers to re-order with a single click.

## Configuration:

Once you have Enabled the Re-Order App under J2Store->Apps, the app places a button in the My profile page, allowing users to re-order the items of an existing order, in a few clicks.

Now click on "Open" under to J2Store->Apps->Re-Order configure the App.

Select the page that the customer should be redirected to post clicking on the Re-Order button displayed next to the order placed by customer at the My profile page.

Now when the customer has placed order for a product and want to re-order the same product they visit the My profile page and click on the "Re-order" button to be directed to either the Cart page or Checkout page (Based on redirect option you set at store backend) and then complete placing the order further from there.
